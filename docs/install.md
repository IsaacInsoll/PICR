# How to install PICR
Picr is built to be run as a docker container on your NAS / Server.
> If you have never used docker before then just google "installer docker on <type-of-server> (EG: windows/linux/synology)

Use the following `docker-compose` file to get started
```yaml
services:
  picr:
    container_name: 'picr'
    image: 'isaacinsoll/picr'
    volumes:
      - <path-to-your-shared-images>:/home/node/app/media:ro # read only access to your 'files i give to clients' folder
      - ./cache:/home/node/app/cache #where PICR will store thumbnails it generates, no need to back it up
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "6900:6900" # presumably reverse proxy will handle HTTPS
    environment:
      - BASE_URL=https://clients.mydomain.com/ #change this to your URL
      - TOKEN_SECRET= # leave this out and on first build it will give you a very secret random string to put in here
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db/picr
      - USE_POLLING=true # recommended if you have > 10,000 files
  db:
    image: postgres:17
    container_name: picr-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: picr
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data #database storage, you should back this up
```
1. Make sure you have docker installed and set up
2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` example above
3. Modify the volume mount for media (IE: change `./media` to the full path on your host where the photos are stored)
4. Set up the compose file in Docker and start PICR. The first run will generate a TOKEN_SECRET (then exit) for you to add to the compose file. Add that info to your `docker-compose` file and restart the container
5. Go to http://<ip-address>:6900/admin and login with default login of `admin` / `picr1234`, change the account details, and start sharing your images!
