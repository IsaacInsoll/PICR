# Notifications

The Picr notification system is basic but does everything you need it to do. 

We use [NTFY](https://ntfy.sh) for notifications as there isn't currently a PICR iOS/Android app.

## How to set up notifications
1. Install NTFY app on the device you want to receive notifications on
2. Make up an impossible to guess NTFY topic eg: `picr-<my_name>-<bunch-of-random-characters>`
3. Log in to PICR as the user who wants notifications (can't be a public link)
4. Edit your user profile and add the NTFY url eg: `https://ntfy.sh/picr-isaac-asdflkjasdflkja`

You will now get notifications when any folders you have access to are accessed by a public link, or when comments/ratings/etc are left.
