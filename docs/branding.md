# Branding and Theming

PICR allows you to customize the appearance of shared galleries with custom branding. This helps photographers maintain their brand identity when sharing photos with clients.

Brandings are **named presets** that can be applied to any folder and will cascade to all subfolders (unless those subfolders have their own branding assigned).

## What Can Be Customized

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | A name to identify this branding (e.g., "Wedding Style", "Corporate") |
| **Heading Font** | The font used for titles and section headers |
| **Theme Mode** | Light, dark, or auto (matches client's device) |
| **Primary Color** | The accent color used throughout the interface |

## Creating a Branding

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branding** tab
2. Click **Add Branding**
3. Enter a name and configure your preferred settings
4. Click **Create**

You can create multiple brandings for different purposes (e.g., one for weddings, one for corporate events).

## Assigning Branding to Folders

1. Navigate to a folder in PICR
2. Click **Manage** to open the folder management panel
3. In the **Branding** dropdown, select a branding preset
4. The folder will immediately use the selected branding

To remove branding from a folder, select **None (inherit from parent)** in the dropdown.

## Branding Inheritance

Branding settings are **inherited** by subfolders. If you assign branding to a parent folder, all subfolders will use those settings unless they have their own branding assigned.

This means you can set branding once at a top-level folder and have it apply to your entire gallery structure.

| **Light** | Always uses light theme |
| **Dark** | Always uses dark theme |

## Primary Colors

Choose from a range of accent colors that will be used for buttons, links, and highlights throughout the interface. The color palette is designed to work well in both light and dark modes.

## Best Practices

1. **Create reusable brandings** - Set up brandings for different client types (weddings, corporate, portraits) and reuse them
2. **Match your brand** - Choose fonts and colors that complement your photography style and business branding
3. **Consider accessibility** - If your clients include older audiences, consider using the Atkinson Hyperlegible fonts
4. **Use Auto theme** - Let clients choose their preferred light/dark mode
5. **Assign at the top level** - Assign branding to parent folders so subfolders inherit it automatically

## Mobile App

The PICR mobile app fully supports custom branding. When clients view galleries through the app, they'll see your custom fonts, colors, and theme settings.
