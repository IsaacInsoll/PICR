| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`                                                                          | Run "_everything_": Server / DB / Frontend in Dev Mode | Used for 90% of development. <br /> Uses nodemon/vite to reload on changes                              |

| `cd backend && MIGRATION_NAME=<yodawg> npm run dk:generate`                         | generate migration files                                | Run when db schema modified and you want to commit changes                                              |
| `cd backend && npm run dk -- push`                                                   | Apply schema directly (no migration file)              | Fast local prototyping before a feature is ready to ship                                                |
| `cd backend && npm run dk -- migrate`                                                | Manually apply committed migration files               | Optional: useful for debugging/recovery. Backend startup usually applies these automatically.           |

## Drizzle Common Workflows

For iterative weekly releases, many migration files are normal and not a problem by themselves.

- Do not edit/delete migrations that have already shipped.
- Prefer small, additive schema changes per PR/release.
- Keep schema changes and related app code in the same release.
- Backend startup runs Drizzle `migrate()` and applies committed migrations automatically.
- Use `push` while prototyping locally, then `generate` and commit the migration before merge/release.
- Validate by starting/restarting backend and confirming migrations apply cleanly.
- If migration history becomes cumbersome, create a fresh baseline at a major version and keep a documented upgrade path for existing installs.

## Dev Server

Ports are exposed during development:

| URL                   | Name                  | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| http://localhost:6900 | PICR Server (backend) | The live updating backend (using nodemon) if you did `npm start`, or a built backend if you are running the container |
| http://localhost:6969 | Front End             | Dynamic frontend (vite HMR) which forwards GQL/file requests to backend (above)<br/>best for front end development    |
| http://localhost:6901 | Testing Server        | When running tests we build a container using this port for running tests against                                     |

For front end development you definitely want to use the 6969 address. For backend either would be fine but I typically just use 6969 anyway.

## Local Quality Gate

Before opening a PR, run these checks locally:

1. `npm run check` (format, lint, and TypeScript across all subsystems)
2. `npm run test:api`
3. `npm run test:e2e:fresh` (when frontend behavior changes)

For full CI parity, run:

- `npm run workflow`

## Current Warning Budget

Warnings are not blockers today, but should not grow:

- `backend`: avoid introducing new warnings; backend `no-console` cleanup is complete and should stay that way.
- `frontend` and `app`: `react/no-array-index-key` warnings are currently tolerated in a few components.

Rule of thumb:

- New code should not introduce additional warnings.
- If you touch a file with existing warnings, prefer cleaning up that warning in the same change.

## Logging Policy

For backend logging:

- Use `logger.info/error/...` for normal runtime logging.
- Use `log(level, message, true)` for boot/startup/migration messages that must appear in container logs.
- Avoid adding `console.*` in backend runtime code.
